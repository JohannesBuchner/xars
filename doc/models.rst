Models
==================

In Buchner et al. (in prep) we irradiated the following geometries,
and you can download xspec table models for them. 

They also have infrared models associated with them.

See the paper for description of the parameters and model assumptions.


UXCLUMPY
--------------------

The Unified X-ray Clumpy model (UXCLUMPY) features:

* Unification: Can produce unobscured, obscured and Compton-thick AGN in the right proportions.
* Eclipse events: The frequency and sizes of eclipses are reproduced by clumps on Keplerian orbits.
* X-ray spectra can fit observations well

* Geometry movies: https://vimeo.com/218031864 and 360 VR https://vimeo.com/253036759
* X-ray table model available at: `uxclumpy.rst`_
* Infrared model available at: http://clumpy.org 
* More information: Buchner et al. (submitted) (or send me an email)
